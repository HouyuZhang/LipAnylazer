## Introduction

The lipidomics technical has broadened our views on lipid metabolism from a systematical level. However, due to the intractable lipid annotation problem, current available analytic methods are designed specifically according to custom protocols (like *LC-MS based* or *shot-gun based*), thus can not be directly transplanted among laboratories. 

We used the LC-MS based protocol to investigate lipid composition dynamics under different physiologic conditions. Thus we developed this pipeline for internal use in daily lipidomics data processing, it starts from raw identified compound information for standardization and normalization, and then regular or custom analysis was conducted based on internal R functions.

This pipeline was written in R language using publishable grammar with well-documented function modules and will be released as a standard R package later.
